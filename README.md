# FacebookClone
  A clone of Facebook login page with pure HTML and CSS
  
  
# Objective

  This project was to practice and improve my perception of elements, like positionals and how to recreate a ready-made layout from scratch with these languages
  
# Learning

  In this project I used a lot of position relative and absolute to position some elements, I focused a lot on the CSS and made the site responsive for those who access from a mobile device.
I didn't find any big challenges, it's a very simple and practical login page fixing well the concepts and use of HTML and Pure CSS will make me master any framework in the future
